## Tools reference
### Creating with Paper
[Marvel App](https://marvelapp.com) - This was used to take a simple interactive paper idea and quickly capture this into a digital interactive form.

### Creating on Screen
[Greensock Animation Library](http://www.greensock.com) - Used to create the animation for the menu system. There's a lot of depth here, but the API for the library is elegant.

[Dat GUI](http://workshop.chromeexperiments.com/examples/gui/#1--Basic-Usage) - This is used to instrument the animations we created for the interactive menu example, see the examples in the link to understand how to bring this into your work.
